- Hi, I’m @karanssh
- I’m interested in building backend systems that work(hopefully well). I also like building software that runs on consumer hardware. I work with golang and java, but like everything.
- Most of my "work" is on private self hosted repositories that are owned by the companies I have worked for, and there's not a lot to look at on this profile. But thanks for visiting!
- You can find me @karanssh on whichever social media you like :)
